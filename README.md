# Tkinter Geometry Manager Examples

This repository contains examples of simple GUI applications built using Tkinter in Python, demonstrating the use of different geometry managers: `pack`, `grid`, and `place`.

## Files Included

1. **pack_calculator.py**: This file demonstrates a basic calculator interface using the pack geometry manager. It features an entry box at the top for displaying numbers, along with buttons for each number and basic calculation operations (+, -, x, /). The entry box is disabled for user input.

2. **grid_calculator.py**: This file showcases a calculator interface created with the grid geometry manager. Similar to the pack calculator, it includes an entry box and buttons for numbers and operations, arranged in a grid layout.

3. **place_login.py**: This file implements a simple login page using the place geometry manager. It features text boxes for entering a username and password, along with a "Login" button.

## How to Run

To run any of these examples, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, execute the desired Python script using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python pack_calculator.py
